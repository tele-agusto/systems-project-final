Demo describes different options for running the pipeline
Reggnn contains the GNN model and evaluators contains the evaluation functions


The mart_export files contain data about regulatory sequences for each gene and the UTR files take this data to form the adjacency matrices
for the GNNs based on how similar these sequences are for different genes
